# Around the U.S. Project PART FOUR!
--------------------------------
### A "not as simple as it once was" HTML, CSS, and JS project for the Web Dev program at Practicum by Yandex

Mostly there:
* In order to get the Card constructor to work, I had to import/copy a bunch of functions from the index.js. Messy, but works.

### Draft 2
* Moved variables to a utils.js file so there didn't need to be repeated code.
* Adjusted buttons in the Card class to delete the class object rather than the template. Took some intense troubleshooting, but it works great now!

Created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript ES6

### Enjoy!
