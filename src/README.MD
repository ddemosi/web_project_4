# Around the U.S. Project PART FOUR!
--------------------------------
### A "not as simple as it once was" HTML, CSS, and JS project for the Web Dev program at Practicum by Yandex

Mostly there:
* All functions refactored to be initialized using classes.
* Production version built with Webpack and WebpackCLI. 
* NPM is a beast. I don't understand much of it, but excited to learn more!
