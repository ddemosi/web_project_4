# Around the U.S. Project!
--------------------------------
### A simple HTML, CSS, and JS project for the Web Dev program at Practicum by Yandex

Mostly there:
* Added some javascript to make the lines clear themselves when you click on them inside the "profile edit" modal, but decided to comment them out for now.
* SVGs are sometimes disappearing on resize? Tried to fix things with the object-fit declaration and whatnot, but still no dice. Only happens at 315px width and below.
* Needs more cowbell

### Draft 2
* Wasn't entirely sure what the review photo meant, but I presumed it meant improper max-width. There's a max-width value listed in the project description at 1200px, while the Figma design file specifies 882px. Changed max-width to the design file spec.
* Fixed the duplicate logo call.

### Draft 3
* Cleaned up a lot of the javascript. Rewrote the modal open/close as functions and simplified the event listener calls.
* Switched all JS to textContent rather than innerHTML.
* Switched all image buttons to html buttons. Took some work, but I think everything is functioning as it should be now.
* Fixed the text-overflow issue. All overflowed text should default to ellipses.
* Fixed various styling bugs.
* Fixed width calculation syntax.
* ***Updated font-family with a generic family name.

### Draft 4

* Moved the add button to a single button with media queries.
* Adjusted javascript functions to a toggle method.
* Removed value scanner and added it as default to the markup.
* Set exit button to type='reset'
