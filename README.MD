# Around the U.S. Project PART THREE!
--------------------------------
### A "not as simple as it once was" HTML, CSS, and JS project for the Web Dev program at Practicum by Yandex

Mostly there:
* The functions I adjusted for the modal slick and keydown event listeners are in a commented space that says "Project 6 Adjusted Functions" Hopefully that makes it easier to find them.
* Wasn't sure where the scripts were supposed to go, so I put them in a script folder.
* Live coding webinar was a lifesaver this time. Validation gets really complicated, really fast, lol. The whole "object as an argument" confused me at first, but I think I understand it now.

### Enjoy!
