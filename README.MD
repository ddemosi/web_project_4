# Around the U.S. Project!
--------------------------------
### A simple HTML, CSS, and JS project for the Web Dev program at Practicum by Yandex

Mostly there:
* Added some javascript to make the lines clear themselves when you click on them inside the "profile edit" modal, but decided to comment them out for now.
* SVGs are sometimes disappearing on resize? Tried to fix things with the object-fit declaration and whatnot, but still no dice. Only happens at 315px width and below.
* Needs more cowbell
